# Zipco Real Estate ETL Pipeline

## Project Overview
**Zipco Real Estate Agency** operates in a fast-paced market where access to timely and accurate property data is critical. This project aims to automate data extraction, transformation, and loading (ETL) processes to improve efficiency, reduce operational costs, and enhance data quality.

## **Project Goals**
- **Automation:** Develop an automated ETL pipeline that runs at defined intervals.
- **Logging & Monitoring:** Implement logging mechanisms to track pipeline performance and detect issues.
- **Data Cleaning & Transformation:** Ensure data accuracy and consistency through structured transformations.
- **Database Loading:** Design an optimized process for inserting transformed data into a **PostgreSQL** database.
- **Data Extraction:** Implement a Python-based solution to fetch property records from a **Real Estate API**.

## **Business Problem**
### Challenges at Zipco Real Estate Agency:
- **Inefficient Data Processing Workflow:** Manual data handling causes delays in accessing critical property information.
- **Increased Operational Costs:** Time-consuming processes such as manual data entry and reconciliation increase costs.
- **Disparate Datasets & Inconsistent Formats:** Lack of uniformity complicates analysis and reporting.
- **Compromised Data Quality:** Inaccurate and outdated information impacts decision-making and business strategy.

## **Tech Stack**
| Technology | Purpose |
|------------|---------|
| **Python** | Scripting for data extraction, cleaning, and transformation |
| **SQL** | Database design, schema creation, and data transformation logic |
| **PostgreSQL** | Relational database for storing and managing ETL data |
| **GitHub** | Version control, documentation, and collaboration |
| **Draw.io** | Creating data flow diagrams and ETL architecture design |
| **Power BI** | Data visualization and dashboard creation for insights |

## **ETL Pipeline Workflow**
1. **Data Extraction:** Fetch property records from the **Real Estate API**.
2. **Data Cleaning & Transformation:** Remove duplicates, handle missing values, standardize formats.
3. **Database Loading:** Store the cleaned data in a **PostgreSQL** database.
4. **Visualization & Reporting:** Use **Power BI** to generate reports and dashboards.

## **How to Run the Project**
### **Prerequisites**
- Install Python 3.x
- Install PostgreSQL
- Install required Python packages using:
  ```bash
  pip install -r requirements.txt
  ```

### **Steps to Run the ETL Pipeline**
1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/ibrahym11/zipco_real_estate_project.git
   cd zipco_real_estate_project
   ```
2. Configure database credentials in `config.py`.
3. Run the ETL script:
   ```bash
   python load_property_data.py
   ```
4. Monitor logs and check the database for updates.
